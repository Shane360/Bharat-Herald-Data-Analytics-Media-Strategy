# Bharat Herald: Post-COVID Analysis and Recovery.
## Introduction
We explored the sharp post-COVID decline in Bharat Herald's print readership (from 1.2 million to 560,000 daily copies from 2019 to 2024), and challenges with its digital platforms, using data provided by [Code Basics](https://codebasics.io/challenges/codebasics-resume-project-challenge/21). The objective is to analyze Bharat Herald's print and digital post-COVID performance, identify factors behind the circulation and ad revenue decline, and develop strategies for a relaunch and optimization of ad revenue - Tools used for this analysis: MySQL and Power BI.

## Executive Summary
COVID-era disruptions had dire effects on legacy media companies, who witnessed a 67% revenue decline in the first quarter of 2021 and with advertising revenues falling by 40% in 2020 from INR 205 billion in 2019 to INR 122 billion. 
Bharat Herald was not spared either, having recorded a 25% drop in print circulation, volatile revenue, and a failed digital pilot. This analysis explores the drivers behind the decline and outlines strategies for a data-driven digital relaunch. 
Bharat Herald’s post-COVID decline in newspaper circulation and the subsequent failure of the digital pilot stemmed from the COVID-era disruptions on physical goods and service delivery, unsatisfactory mobile UX, and low adoption of the mobile platforms. Other issues also persist that have led to volatile advertising revenues. 
Despite the above, the data shows clear digital adoption trends in key cities like Mumbai, Varanasi, and Ahmedabad, with digital readiness indexes of 0.619, 0.701, and 0.692, respectively, and a cumulative engagement of 1.1 million (downloads and accesses). This offers an opportunity to relaunch improved digital platforms without the identified UX issues (poor font and slow load times). 

## Findings - What Went Wrong
### 1.	Post-COVID decline:
  Revenue dropped by 2.44%, from ~INR 368 million in 2019 to ~INR 359 million in 2020, before recovering by 1.89% in 2024 (~INR 374.9 million).

Circulation dropped by an alarming 85.7% from a total of ~207 million copies in 2019 (~159.5 million copies in Hindi and ~47 million copies in English) to ~29.5 million copies in total in 2024. This is because of post-pandemic shifts to digital consumption.

### 2.	Digital pilot: 
The pilot achieved decent adoption (54.5% engagement rate on average) but low retention due to UX/UX issues such as long load times, small fonts, and inability to zoom. These issues influence bounce rate, which was a high 65.85% on average across all cities. Other factors, such as limited internet access and smartphone access, led to the initial failure in a few cities.

### 3.	Revenue fluctuations: 
From the data, these factors contributed to the decline:

- Concerns regarding price hikes: caused the -16.69% YoY revenue decline in 2020; a loss of ~ INR 21 million in Government revenue, and ~INR 29 million losses from FMCGs.

- Seasonal drop in demand led to declines in Government revenue in Q3 2019, Q1 2020, and Q3 2023. This, however, did not affect the Real Estate and Automobile industries as we recorded a surge in YoY revenue by 14.6% (for the Real Estate category in 2020) and 32.39% for the Automobile category in 2024.

- Real Estate slowdown might have contributed to the decline in Real Estate YoY revenues in 2022 (-13.73%), but it was not an isolated reason.

## Recommendations
### 1.	Relaunch Digital Platforms: 

- Resolve UI/UX issues on WhatsApp, Web, and e-Mobile platforms.

- Run targeted ads on social media platforms.

- Focus relaunch on key growth cities such as Varanasi, Mumbai, and Ahmedabad.

- Build a functional platform ecosystem that will unlock new ad revenue streams. 

### 2.	Market Re-engagement:
- Strengthen presence in cities with potential and consolidate presence in high-performing cities such as Lucknow and Patna.

### 3.	Restore Advertiser Confidence: 

- Introduce discounted ad bundles and highlight expanded reach potential (including foreign audiences).

- Rebuild trust with FMCGs and the Government through transparency and measurable ROI
